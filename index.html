            <h1>Lyrics</h1>
            <pre>
                [Verse 1]
                I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
                I threw the day old tea from the cup
                Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
                Memories of a life that's been loved
                Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
                Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
                Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
                But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink
                
                [Pre-Chorus]
                Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
                A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
                
                [Chorus]
                So I'll sing Hallelujah
                You were an angel in the shape of my mum
                When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
                Spread your wings as you go
                When God takes you back
                He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
                
                [Verse 2]
                I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
                Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
                John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
                And wiped a tear from the side of my face
                See Ed Sheeran Live

                [Pre-Chorus]
                And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
                A life with love is a life that's been lived
                
                [Chorus]
                So I'll sing Hallelujah
                You were an angel in the shape of my mum
                When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
                Spread your wings as you go
                When God takes you back
                He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
                
                [Bridge]
                (Ooh)
                (Ooh)
                (Ooh)
                (Ooh)
                
                [Chorus]
                Hallelujah
                You were an angel in the shape of my mum
                You got to see the person I have become
                Spread your wings and I know
                That when God took you back
                He said, "Hallelujah, you're home"
